# README

With this setup you can create a `vagrant` base OS X VM / box.

This setup should be compatible with most Virtual Machine
tools / hypervisors supported by `vagrant`, like VirtualBox, Parallels or vSphere,
only the packaging depends on the actual tool.

You can find tool specific setup & packaging instructions below.

      be simply used with `vagrant`


## Request a tool to be pre-installed

**If you'd like to add a tool** to be pre-installed you can create a
Pull Request, adding your changes to the `playbook.yml` ([Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com) playbook) of this repository.
*Please also add* a related test/report to the `system_report.sh` file,
which is used to test & list the pre-installed tools.

If you want to add a **weekly cache update** script, you should do
that in `weekly-cache-update-playbook.yml`. This should **not** change any
pre-installed tool version, nor should it install any new tool; the
weekly cache update should only update already installed tools' caches,
for example the `CocoaPods` or `brew` spec caches.

When a new version of this stack is available on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io)
we'll run `system_report.sh` and post the result into
the [bitrise.io GitHub repository](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io), under the `system_reports` folder.

*We're still working on proper Pull Request checks, if your PR checks
would fail there's probably no issue at all, we'll let you know
if you have to change anything.*


## Create VM & OS X installation

### VMware vSphere specific

* Create a new OS X VM
    * 4 GB RAM
    * 2 CPU
        * Allow: `Hardware virtualization` - expand the CPU options, and enable this option
    * about 200 GB disk space
* Start the VM
* Install OS X:
    * OS X won't see the hard drive, you'll have to open Disk Utility (you can
      find it in the menu bar of the OS X installer) and format the disk
    * Select the 200 GB disk on the left side, and then Erase it
    * Format: Mac OS Extended (Journaled)
    * Name: Macintosh HD
    * Scheme: GUID Partition Map
    * Close Disk Utility, you should now be able to select this disk for the install.
    * Follow the: OS X Install guide (common) section
* Wait for Spotlight indexing to finish
* Shut down the VM and remove the OS X Installer ISO (cdrom)
* Save it as a "vanilla box" (as a VM or even better, as a Template)
* When preparing for a specific setup (e.g. Xcode version)
    * clone this "vanilla box"
    * update to the OS X version you want
    * double check the "Once installed:" section of "OS X Install guide (common)" section
        * in some cases OS X version update might turn off e.g. Remote Login!
    * install the VMware Tools
    * check and wait if Spotlight is indexing
    * Save it as an environment specific "base box"
    * Continue with Provisioning

#### Disable macOS SIP (System Integration Protection) in vSphere

If you can't hit Command+R fast enough when the VM boots (you most likely can't):

Click on VM and select tab Summary and then
under VM Hardware -> Edit Settings: VM Options: Boot Options: Boot Delay Enter 10000 as milliseconds ( 10 seconds ).

Start the VM, open it's tab/window, click into (just to be sure it has keyboard focus),
and start keep holding Command+R. VMware boot manager menu will appear -

        * In the EFI menu, select Enter setup > Configure boot options > Add boot options > select Recovery partition > select boot.efi
        * In the Input the description box, hit Enter and type recovery and hit Enter again. Choose Commit changes and exit
        * Next, select recovery option under Boot Manager and follow instructions until you see the MacOS Utilities menu
        * Select Utilities >Terminal in the MacOS Utilities menu and type csrutil status to get the current SIP status
        * Then type csrutil disable to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP)
        * Reboot the VM and check csrutil statusagain to ensure SIP is disabled

__Restore the boot delay to 0 once you manage to boot into Recovery mode!__

### Parallels specific [no longer maintained]

*We used this setup for quite a long time, but not anymore,
and so this setup is no longer actively maintained.
Feel free to extend this guide if you have more information / if the
guide is not up-to-date anymore.*

* Create a new OS X VM
  * Select the "from DVD or image file" option
    * Select the "Image file" option and Drag-and-Drop the "Install OS X ..." (.app) installer
    * Parallels will most likely create a "bootable" image from the "Install OS X ..." installer
    * Once it's ready make sure to enable the "Customize settings before installation" option
  * Set these VM settings:
    * Options
      * Advanced: Do not sync the time from the host OS X (without the Parallels Tools installed in the VM it's not an option anyway)
      * Advanced: don't share the clipboard
    * Hardware
      * 4 GB RAM
      * 2 CPU
      * 32 MB Video memory
    * Security
      * enable Isolate Mac from virtual machine (disables shared folders, clipboard sharing, etc.)
* Start the VM
* Install OS X:
  * Follow the: OS X Install guide (common) section

### VirtualBox specific [experimental / not maintained]

*Experimental: we don't actively use this configuration.
This guide was created for VirtualBox 4.x, might or might not work with 5.x .
Feel free to extend this guide if you have more information / if the
guide is not up-to-date anymore.*

Some notes for experimenting with VirtualBox based OS X VMs:

* how to install OS X guest in VirtualBox running on OS X: [http://engineering.bittorrent.com/2014/07/16/how-to-guide-for-mavericks-vm-on-mavericks/](http://engineering.bittorrent.com/2014/07/16/how-to-guide-for-mavericks-vm-on-mavericks/)
  * detailed step-by-step guide, with images, from step 0 (downloading OS X installer from the App Store) to up-and-running
  * NOTES:
    * the new Haswell based Intel CPUs are still not yet properly supported
    and require a (quick) workaround - detailed in the article.
    * to tweak the CPU performance you could try other CPU IDs:
      * VBoxManage modifyvm <vmname> --cpuidset 1 000206a7 02100800 1fbae3bf bfebfbff [source](https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/12802)
    * our best configuration so far (set it before starting the VM!)
      * 2 CPU, execution cap 100%
      * 4096 MB RAM
      * Chipset: PIIX3
      * 128MB VRAM (video ram)
      * enable all the acceleration features (except 2D acceleration)
      * if required: VBoxManage modifyvm <vmname> --cpuidset 1 000206a7 02100800 1fbae3bf bfebfbff
* to be able to SSH into the VM through the default NAT network adapter
  (which is required for vagrant) you have to set up a port forwarding
  with: host 127.0.0.1 port 2222 -> guest 22
    * vagrant does this automatically but if you want to test
      the SSH login of the box before packaging it you'll have to
      do it yourself
* Start the VM
* Install OS X:
  * Follow the: OS X Install guide (common) section

**Important Note**

> VirtualBox's snapshot rollback doesn't start the VM if the snapshot
> was taken when the VM was running. Parallels does this (turns the VM on
> even if it's not running when you roll back to the snapshot) but
> VirtualBox does not, you have to ensure the VM is turned on.


## OS X Install guide (common)

* During install select the default options everywhere, except:
  * Apple ID: select "Don't sign in"
* Username should be: "vagrant" with the same password ("vagrant")
  * Turn off "require password to unlock screen"
  * Turn off "Set time zone based on current location"
  * Turn off "Send Diagnostics & Usage data to Apple"
* Register this Mac: don't register

Once installed:

* Enable "Remote Login" in the Sharing Preference Pane. This enables SSH.
* Disable automatic updates in Preferences - App Store
* Disable every sleep option in Preferences - Energy Saver
* Make sure automatic login is enabled in Preferences - Users and Groups (Login Options).
* Disable the Screen Saver
* Check & wait for Spotlight to finish indexing
* Restart
    * Disable "Reopen windows when logged back in"
* Check `Activity Monitor` to see if there are any unnecessary daemon processes,
  which consume significant CPU/Memory
* Disable macOS SIP (System Integration Protection).
    * You can do it in Recovery mode:
        * When the VM boots hold: Command+R
        * This should boot macOS into Recovery mode
        * If you can't press&hold Cmd+R fast enough search for a solution for the virtualization tool.
          In case of vSphere you can find a guide in the
          "VMware vSphere specific/Disable macOS SIP (System Integration Protection) in vSphere" section above.
    * Once Recover mode boots select Utilities -> Terminal
    * And run the command: csrutil disable

    * To enable the update automation
    add the Terminal and the Script Runner apps to `System Preferences - Security and Privacy - Accessability`
    also run the machine-setup/playbook.yml on the machine to enable access to system events
    you will need to run this from your dev machine, because the setting needs manual interaction, so the automation would time out.
    
* Add SSH key to authorized keys
* Add `vagrant` user as passwordless sudoer

## Provisioning

### Install Xcode - can be saved as an intermediate template

* Run `xcode-select --install` and install the Xcode Command Line Tools (popup should appear)
* __Wait for the CLT install to finish__, or else the `/usr/include` paths won't be created!
* Install the Xcode version you want to use, to the canonical path (`/Applications/Xcode.app` or `/Applications/Xcode-beta.app` in case of beta Xcode)
  * Open it after the install, accept the EULA
  * Create a test iOS project with UI Tests, build & run tests - allow Developer mode when prompted
  * Create a test Mac OS X project with UI Tests, build & run tests - allow Accessibility for UI tests when prompted
  * install all the available SDKs and Simulators
    * Xcode -> Preferences -> Downloads -> Components
  * open the iOS Simulator from Xcode -> Open Developer Tools (in the statusbar menu) -> iOS Simulator and validate that it works

### Final steps: Run auto setups, with ansible

* Check the available OS X updates in the App Store (don't sign into the App Store!),
  and install the system updates, then reboot the VM.

*NOTE: you should call the bitrise commands from a `tmux` session,
to make it easier to manage the process, as some of the steps take
quite some time.*

* To activate the vagrant insecure key, which will be used during the setup:
  * If your ssh-agent is not running: `eval $(ssh-agent)`
  * then: `ssh-add ./vagrant-insecure_private_key`

* For a base Vagrant specific setup use the `vagrant-setup-playbook.yml` - run it with `ansible`
  * From another host:
    * open `bitrise.yml` from this directory, and define the environment variables listed at the top
      * you should define those in the `.bitrise.secrets.yml`, saved into this directory
    * that's all, you can now run `bitrise run vagrant-setup`

* Now you can run the actual VM environment setup:
  * with bitrise CLI: `bitrise run provision-vm`
* To prepare the required tools & caches, run: `bitrise run perform-weekly-cache-update`
  * This is the step which actually installs the Bitrise CLI, as well as prepares it's caches
* NOTE: you can also `bitrise trigger step/X` these workflows, where `X` is the order of the step
  * e.g. `bitrise trigger step/1` runs the same as `bitrise run vagrant-setup`, as that's the first Bitrise CLI "step" of this guide

## Layout of this repository

* Root (the directory this README file is in) contains the main `ansible` setup playbooks, and this guide/overview README
* `tools` dir: will be synchronized as-it-is to the Virtual Machine, under `$HOME/bitrise/tools`


## OS X version notes

* This repository is meant to be used / tested with OS X El Capitan (10.11)
* Other OS X versions should also work, but might require minor modifications
  * Previous OS X versions (up until 10.11) stored the `sshd_config` in `/etc/sshd_config` - this changed in `10.11` to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

## Execute the base* tests

### Requirements

* molecule, testinfra and ddt needs to be installed: `pip3 install molecule testinfra ddt`
* anka installed: `brew cask install anka-virtualization`
* base image in either stopped or suspended state name must be: `baseOS_10-15`

### Execute the tests:

* Go to `roles/tests`
* Execute molecule tests: `molecule -s baseXcode test`
* This command will create a simple anka vm with `molecule-test` name, execute the mentioned roles in the `baseXcode/converge.yml` file, executes the tests, delete the previously created anka vm`

### Validate your existing machine

* Go to `roles/tests` directory
* Execute the following command: `molecule -s base verify`
